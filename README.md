# Random Password Generator

### This is a project build for generating random password of length ranging from 8 - 24

### While creating this project learned about different hooks and their uses:
    - useCallback():helps React remember functions, so they don't have to be recreated every time your component re-renders. useCallback(fn, [dependencies])
    - useEffect(): helps your React components do something whenever certain things change, like when the component first shows up, or when some data it needs is updated. useEffect (fn, [dependencies])
    - useRef() : helps you keep track of important things in your app

Dependencies:  The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the fn code
